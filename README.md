# RSS Feed
This is a Python program that allows you to look at an RSS feed without having to browse on the Internet manually to do so. Run `python3 rss-feed.py` in a terminal if you have Python 3.

NOTE: This program requires a module called `feedparser` - install it by running this command:

```
pip install feedparser
```
